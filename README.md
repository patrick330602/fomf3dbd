# omcsf

OMCSF is a direct fork of `develop` branch of [openmicroscopy](https://github.com/openmicroscopy)/[openmicroscopy](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy) on commit [aafbd2d](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/commit/aafbd2dac41d3f8e10652ba8669d0e00d5b8bb64). This is intended to be built as a bio-data management system. 

## Explanation

> Why a seperate repository instead of fork directly?

The origin repository is way too large for us. it's 1.8 Gigabytes and we have a limited network, and we need to build on a clean branch.

OMERO_Eclipse_Code_Style.xml is a properties file which can be
imported into Eclipse 3.2+ via the
 
  Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter

dialog. All code should be formatted with this style BEFORE checkin.

This code style is equivalent to the standard "Java Conventions"
Eclipse code style with all tabs converted to spaces.

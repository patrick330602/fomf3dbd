/** 
 * Verifies the execution of a {@link BatchCallTree} is carried out as
 * expected.
 * This test is performed with the help of a {@link FakeBatchCallTree} and
 * a {@link SyncBatchCallMonitor}.  The first provides a concrete subclass
 * of {@link BatchCallTree} and builds the actual call tree.  Moreover, it
 * replaces the default 
 * {@link org.openmicroscopy.shoola.util.concur.tasks.CmdProcessor} with a
 * {@link org.openmicroscopy.shoola.util.concur.tasks.SyncProcessor} (so the
 * tree will be executed within the JUnit thread) and the default call monitor
 * (a {@link BatchCallMonitor}) with a {@link SyncBatchCallMonitor} (which will
 * dispach the tree's execution events in the JUnit thread).
 * Because all the {@link SyncBatchCallMonitor} does is overriding the 
 * <code>deliver</code> method, this test implicitly verifies the behavior of
 * {@link BatchCallMonitor}.  In turn, an instance of this latter class would
 * not work properly if the {@link BatchCallTree} didn't delegate calls to
 * its root node, so we also implicitly verify delegation.

    //tests that feedback events are received up to the cancellation point and
    //then an outcome event is received that informs of cancellation.  However,
    //this is basically what we've been doing in the exception tests.  The only
    //difference with cancellation is that onCancel() should be invoked instead
    //of onAbort().  But we've already verified above what happens if onCancel()
    //is called.  In conclusion, we can skip the test to verify cancellation in
    //the midst of execution.

/** 
 * Ancestor of all Data Services test cases.
 * A Data Service test case verifies the operation of any of the Data Services
 * made available by the Container: Data Management Service, Semantic Types
 * Service, Pixels Service, and Data Services Views. 
 * <p>This class conveniently inherits from <code>TestCase</code> so that a 
 * Data Services test case can be run by JUnit.  The JUnit's hook method 
 * {@link #setUp() setUp} is overridden to factor out the functionality common
 * to all test cases &#151; so sublcasses should first call <code>super.setUp()
 * </code> if they override this method too.</p>
 * <p>Altough you write a Data Services test case as a regular JUnit test case,
 * there are several things to keep in mind, regarding the test environment:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li><b>OMEDS</b>.  A live instance of <i>OMEDS</i> is needed by the 
 *   underlying Data Services.  So a Data Services test case depends on
 *   <i>external</i> resources.</li>
 *  <li><b>OMEDS Connnection</b>.  The connection to the server is managed
 *   transparently by the Login Service, which operates in test mode &#151;
 *   see {@link org.openmicroscopy.shoola.env.data.login.BatchLoginService}.
 *   (So no UI is ever brought on screen to ask for user's credentials, which
 *   are specified through system properties &#151; along with the server's
 *   address, see {@link Env}.)  The <i>connection</i> is used for all tests  
 *   in a session.  Note that if a test fails because of an invalid link to 
 *   <i>OMEDS</i>, the Login Service will try reestablishing a valid link under
 *   the hood and so the next test may run just fine.  However, if a vaild link
 *   can't be reestablished (for example, a permanent network failure) then all
 *   subsequent tests will obviously fail.</li>
 *  <li><b>Container</b>.  It's started in test mode and the only available
 *   services will be the Data Services.  (All other services are replaced
 *   with no-op services.)  In particular, no UI is linked to the Container and
 *   thus no Agents either.  The Container instance is static and spans an 
 *   entire test session &#151; which, in most cases, is the same as the JVM
 *   process life-time.  You can access the Container's registry directly by
 *   using the protected field made available by this class.</li>
 *  <li><b>Threading</b>.  The Container and all its services are run in a 
 *   single thread, which is the same as the one in which JUnit is run.
 *   (Even the Data Services Views use this thread.)  So a Data Services test
 *   case is single-threaded &#151; unless you explicitly spawn other threads,
 *   which we reccommend you <i>don't</i> do.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>Finally some guidelines to run Data Services test cases.  First off, you
 * should set up a test <i>OMEDS</i> instance, which in turn runs on a test DB.
 * This is the server that you're then going to use for the Data Services tests.
 * Second, run all the Data Services tests together in a separate JVM process.
 * This is a good idea because of the dependency on external resources and
 * the singleton instance of the Container (and its services) which is shared
 * among all tests in a session.</p>

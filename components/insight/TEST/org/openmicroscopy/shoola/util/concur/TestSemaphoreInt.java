/** 
 * Verifies that {@link Semaphore} correctly aborts in the case of interruption.
 * Each test spawns an ad-hoc thread which is interrupted to verify how 
 * {@link Semaphore} reacts to interruption.  The result of the test is passed
 * back into the main flow (JUnit) so to perform the needed assertions.  
 * Note that we never interrupt JUnit.  Spawning another thread might seem 
 * unecessary when we could just interrupt JUnit and then clear the interrupted
 * status after the test.  However implementation characteristics of 
 * interruption-based methods are quite uncertain, so we prefer using a 
 * separate thread (which is simply discarded at the end of the test) rather
 * than interrupting JUnit and making thus room for possible side effects.

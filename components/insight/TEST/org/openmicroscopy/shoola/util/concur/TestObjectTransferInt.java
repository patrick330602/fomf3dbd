/** 
 * Verifies that {@link ObjectTransfer} correctly aborts in the case of 
 * interruption.
 * We call <code>handOff</code> and <code>collect</code> in interrupted threads
 * and verify they return right on by throwing an {@link InterruptedException}.
 * We then verify that if an hand-off is in progress in the producer thread,
 * then this thread will rendezvous with the consumer doing collection even
 * in the face of interruption.
 * <p><b>NOTE</b>:
 * Each test spawns an ad-hoc thread which is interrupted to verify how 
 * {@link ObjectTransfer} reacts to interruption.  The result of the test is 
 * passed back into the main flow (JUnit) so to perform the needed assertions.  
 * Note that we never interrupt JUnit.  Spawning another thread might seem 
 * unecessary when we could just interrupt JUnit and then clear the interrupted
 * status after the test.  However implementation characteristics of 
 * interruption-based methods are quite uncertain, so we prefer using a 
 * separate thread (which is simply discarded at the end of the test) rather
 * than interrupting JUnit and making thus room for possible side effects.</p>
